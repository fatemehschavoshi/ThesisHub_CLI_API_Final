It supports the full lifecycle: course request → supervisor approval → defense scheduling → scoring → archive. 
Features include atomic JSON repository with backups, human/JSONL audit logs, windowed notifications, 
secure PDF/JPEG ingestion, Persian-first PDF minutes (RTL/QR), and a simple FA/EN search.
